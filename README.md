============

This is a working, collaborative document between the staff at the University of Michigan's [Michigan Publishing](http://www.publishing.umich.edu) and [Hypothes.is](http://hypothes.is). We're interested in exploring ways that Hypothes.is can be integrated into different parts of the scholarly publishing lifecycle such as peer review, authoring, and copy editing. 

If you're interested in contributing or participating in the authoring of this document, feel free to make annotations on the [web version](http://h-publishing.jmcglone.com), [get in touch with us](mailto:mpublishing@umich.edu), or fork the repository and initiate a pull request.
