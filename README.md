============

This is working, collaborative document between the staff at the University of Michigan's [Michigan Publishing](http://www.publishing.umich.edu) and [Hypothes.is](http://hypothes.is). We're interested in exploring ways that Hypothes.is can be integrated into different parts of the scholarly publishing lifecycle such as peer review, authoring, and copy editing. If you're interested in contributing, feel free to [get in touch](mailto:mpublishing@umich.edu) or just fork and initiate a pull request.

You can find the source code for and learn how to contribute to the hypothes.is project at [github.com/hypothesis/h](https://github.com/hypothesis/h).
